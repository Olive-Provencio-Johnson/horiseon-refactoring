# horiseon-refactoring

 
## Description

The focus of this project was to make the code more accessible for screen readers and improve search engine optimization (SEO), as well as cleaning up any code inefficiencies or redundancies. Overall, the main code functions and the webpages original display and styling were not altered, but the code was improved.
